                My name is Amanda Soares and I believe that we can be agents of
                transformation in science and technology. I want to encourage, support, and
                empower girls in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
                Mathematics), promoting a fairer, more diverse, and innovative society.
              </p>

                I am an enthusiast, an enabler, and an agent of transformation. I believe in
                the power of science and technology to transform the world and people. I
                have experience in creating and leading projects that positively impact the
                lives of girls, awakening their interest and confidence in STEM. My
                purpose is to apply my knowledge and skills to develop innovative and
                creative solutions for various sectors.

                One of my projects is ConsCientistas, which I co-founded with other
                incredible women. It has directly impacted more than 1200 girls and has
                been supported by organizations like For√ßa Meninas. We inspire and
                empower girls to become interested and involved in STEM through talks,
                mentoring and conversation circles. Another project I led was Sem Parar,
                where I taught girls how to hunt asteroids. It's a free initiative aimed at
                awakening girls' interest and passion for the exact and biological sciences.

                In addition to wanting to continue helping the population access quality
                information and education in STEM, I have a strong desire to work in the
                field of aeronautics. My goal is to contribute to technological innovations
                that can impact the space sector. I see this journey as an opportunity not
                only to achieve a great dream but also to apply my skills to projects that
                drive scientific and technological progress.

                My passions guide me both in my personal and professional life. They bring
                me purpose and happiness, while also teaching me the fundamental values such
                as respect, dedication, humility, and gratitude. My goal is to help create an
                environment where more people can develop their potential, learn, and
                express themselves, contributing to a fairer, more inclusive, and innovative
                society.
